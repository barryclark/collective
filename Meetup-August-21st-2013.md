## Topics

#### Managing a Remote Dev Team

Wesley brought up the topic of things that are important when managing a remote software development team. 

We concluded that one of the most important things in managing a remote team is having trust in the workers. You don't want to be constantly asking them for updates or being concerned that they'll flake. That can probably only come from trialling working with people are really sticking with those that you can trust. 

You really need to have a system in place where you can track work based on tasks performed rather than hours worked. Surely Joel Spolsky must have blogged on that!

We noted that communication is key, and that if someone ends up getting derailed to work on a 3–4 hour bug fix then they should have to ask for approval for this first. 

Wes, here's another link I like on the topic: [21 Weeks In - How to Manage a Remote Team by Wade Foster](https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/)

Barry found this [post on working from home](http://lifehacker.com/the-beginners-guide-to-working-from-home-733412770) really useful, it's from a remote engineer's perspective. 

Also, 37 Signals new book [Remote](http://37signals.com/remote) comes out soon.

#### Finding Niche Markets

This topic came from Barry recently reading [Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide to Launching a Startup](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968/). This book is really focused on building a small business in a niche market, rather than a startup in a big market. There are lots of advantages, all covered in the book, but we focused on ways to discover niche markets and again attacked the question "how do you figure out what problems people are having that aren't 20–30 year old male engineer types?". 

First of all, finding non tech people to talk with and just asking them about regular problems they have with their job or hobbies is good.

Then we shifted into more of a business idea, for non-technical people to input their problems or things that frustrate them. Building a mailing list of people to regularly survey around different areas could be cool too. Potentially an app for older people that want to keep up to date with tech, that could also survey their problems on a regular basis.  

Maybe a list of problems and also track how many of them annoy people on a regular basis and how annoying they are. Pretty sure there's a site that does something like that. (It'd be great if...)

It could also be a platform to launch MVPs and test business ideas with, blasting them out to the email list and asking for feedback. 

I wonder if there's a forum that does something like this to check out?

#### App Idea: ETA

Dave brought up an idea for a mobile app: ETA. The use case was primarily in a subway, to let you know where you're at and how close to your destination you are. The app would potentially be a lot like Hopstop, but with the ability of knowing where you're at underground. 

This brought up a lot of conversation around uses for geofencing, including:

- Wes's app which shows you how long it'll be until your friends arrive at an event based on their currently location and velocity. 
— Barry's idea which would be used to geofence the location that you're going to and alert you when you get there. The use case was knowing when you're about to arrive at your destination on a train, much like Uber tells you when your cab is arriving. 

#### Most Valuable Plaform/Framework/Skill to Learn 

We all agreed that iOS/Android development is probably the most profitable thing to learn right now, especially as it's so specialized. Android has a huge amount of potential as it's just reached the point where it's monetizing really well, but if your engineering on contract that doesn't even matter so much anyway. There are just a huge shortage of native mobile app engineers and that shortage is only likely to grow and grow. 

We thought it'd be a cool side project to track the trends of different technologies and frameworks. Maybe a site which graphs the month to month trends of technologies like PHP/Ruby/Python against each other by Github popularity, job board postings, etc. It'd be interesting to see which skills are coming into demand, but also which skills are going out of demand. 

#### App Idea: Schedule.me

Schedule.me is Maxwell's idea for a todo list with location based integration. The core idea is being able to assign locations to todos, with options of notifying you when you're nearby those locations. For example, having a list of items to collect from different shops, like Wine, Coffee, etc. The app could notify you when you're nearby somewhere on your list that's open and help you plan out the most optimal ways to get things done based on where you are. 

We also thought it might be cool to have a todo list that changed based on where you were, being able to assign tasks that you'd do at home, at work, or elsewhere.
