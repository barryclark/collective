## Topics

#### Gaining insight into other markets/industries

Talking to people using [Dane Maxwell's technique](http://mixergy.com/listen-to-dane-maxwell-call-a-prospect-and-hear-how-he-extracts-a-profitable-business-idea/) rocks. Also, [Nathan Barry talks about the same thing](http://nathanbarry.com/finding-ideas-project/).  

[Jason Evanish podcast on customer development](http://productpeople.tv/2013/03/27/ep19-jason-evanish-shares-his-process-for-understanding-customers/) also [Barry's notes on the podcast](https://gist.github.com/barryclark/5258086).

Sounds a lot like the consensus is that, for us, building a quick splash screen MVP with just the value proposition on it is the best. Using Jason Evanish's technique above.

Creating an MVP and posting it to Facebook Groups can be really helpful. Taking communication right into Facebook Chat is great for quick customer interviews.

You should validate demand for your business idea without writing a single line of code.

#### Finding users for SaaS

Offering a beta for early adopters.

Cold calling people.

#### Things developers want from a recruiter

This topic was brought up by Barry based on an idea for becoming a specialized agent/recruiter for developers. 

1 time pricing, based on a package would be great. 

People would want to see a lot of information about me, and why they'd want to hire me. Personal brand would be important. 

Potentially offer the coaching for free, with finding them a job and collecting the referral fee being the upsell. 

Could potentially label this as a career coach, with an upsell to referring to jobs. 

Things developers want:

- To believe that the recruiter understands them technically, and can find them the type of job within their skillset that they're looking for.
- To find out that they're asking for the appropriate amount of money. How much salary should I be asking for? There's a lot of opportunity cost in closing too low a salary and leaving money on the table. Potentially help with negociating salary too. 
- Help with mock interviewing, including honest feedback. 

Other ideas:

- This could be an idea that transfers to every field. For example recruiting lawyers, which can pay a full years salary in a referral fee. 
- Hacker news topic with going rates for developers. 
- Check out Patio 11

#### Crowd sourced environment data

We honed in on the idea of creating a platform where people can request a pic to be taken of a certain thing at a specified location. 

Build it, Desmond! 

#### Micro hackathons

Lot of interest in forming micro-hackathons that run for 1â€“2 days over the weekend where we build an MVP or product. 

We could spec the product out throughout the week running up to the hackathon, including all users stories and everything a developer needs to build it.
