## Welcome to Collective!

We're an invite only group of NYC based hackers that meet up once per month to discuss startup ideas and entrepreneurship.

**One principle: Everyone in this group has the technical ability to build their own ideas**.

I've attended many meetups filled with business people pitching me their startup ideas: "I have my idea all figured out, I just need an engineer to build it!". The goal of this group is to get engineers together to share knowledge, ideate and collaborate on our own startup ideas, without the business pitches.

#### Next Meetup - October

Mobile app meetup featuring [Lean Coffee](http://www.slideshare.net/SteveRogalsky/a-guide-to-lean-coffee) and show and tell at [DoSomething.org HQ in Flatiron](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=dosomething.org) in October, date TBA.
